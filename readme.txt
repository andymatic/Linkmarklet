Linkmarklet is an alternative to the Press This! bookmarklet aimed at rapid link blogging

== Description ==

Instead of the traditional Press This! interface, Linkmarklet offers a much more streamlined UI allowing you to linkblog quickly. Upon clicking the bookmarklet, Linkmarklet will present you with a simple way of editing the page title, the page link, the page slug, and the post content. In the settings you can define two things:

1.  The category to which Linkmarklet posts will be added
2.  The Custom Field name you're using to store the submitted link

That's about it. Clicking Post pushes the entry live instantly. More features forthcoming.

== Installation ==

1. Upload Linkmarklet to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
